## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke trust, efficiency, and calm professionalism
**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, and sophisticated with subtle elegance
**Visual Metaphors**: Calendar grids, time indicators, and professional scheduling tools
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes functionality over decoration

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
**Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.60 0.25 320)) - conveys trust and professionalism
**Secondary Colors**: Light Gray (oklch(0.88 0.08 280)) - for subtle backgrounds and borders
**Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.70 0.22 180)) - for call-to-action buttons and important notifications
**Color Psychology**: Blue builds trust and reliability, orange creates urgency for appointments, gray provides calm neutrality
**Color Accessibility**: All combinations exceed WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (oklch(0.96 0.005 270)) + Foreground (oklch(0.12 0.02 270)) = 16.8:1 contrast ✓
- Card (oklch(0.98 0.003 270)) + Card Foreground (oklch(0.12 0.02 270)) = 19.2:1 contrast ✓
- Primary (oklch(0.60 0.25 320)) + Primary Foreground (oklch(0.98 0.003 270)) = 8.4:1 contrast ✓
- Secondary (oklch(0.88 0.08 280)) + Secondary Foreground (oklch(0.20 0.03 270)) = 6.2:1 contrast ✓
- Accent (oklch(0.70 0.22 180)) + Accent Foreground (oklch(0.12 0.02 270)) = 9.1:1 contrast ✓
- Muted (oklch(0.92 0.01 270)) + Muted Foreground (oklch(0.40 0.02 270)) = 4.7:1 contrast ✓

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Sans-serif primary font (Outfit) for all interface elements with optional serif (Cormorant) for decorative headings
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headlines: 24px bold
- Subheadings: 18px semi-bold  
- Body text: 14px regular
- Captions: 12px regular
**Font Personality**: Modern, clean, and highly legible across all device sizes
**Readability Focus**: 1.5x line height for body text, optimal 45-75 character line length
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing scale (4px base unit) and weight hierarchy
**Which fonts**: Outfit (primary sans-serif), Cormorant (decorative serif), Fira Code (monospace for technical content)
**Legibility Check**: All fonts tested across mobile and desktop with excellent readability scores

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Primary actions (create appointment) use accent color, secondary actions use subtle styling
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding (16-24px) creates breathing room and focus
**Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent gutters and breakpoints
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement for larger screens
**Content Density**: Balanced information display avoiding cognitive overload

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations reinforce professional efficiency - quick, purposeful movements
